#:1this bit of code opens the file you will not see the file being actually open on your screen it will be opened in the background of the python IDLE

file = open("my_file.txt")

#:2the code below is used to print the file contents in the terminal

contents = file.read()
print(contents)
file.close()

'''always remember to close all the files that you open so that all the resources of your computer gets free again'''

#:3 another wat to open file is using 'with' keyword

with open("my_file.txt") as file:
    contents = file.read()
    print(contents)

'''this 'with' keyword does not require to use file.close() as it is know to do it'''

#:4 writing in the file

with open("my_file.txt",mode="w") as file:
    contents = file.write("new text using file.write")
    print(contents)

'''now when u look at file.txt u will see the old text deleted and new content init'''
#:5 appending in a file means not replacing the contents of file but adding content into the file

with open("my_file.txt",mode="a") as file:
    contents = file.write("\n new line of text after write mode is append")
    print(contents)


'''imp thing if u try to open a file that does not exist in write mode then this mode will try to create that file from scratch '''
with open("new_file.txt",mode="w") as file:
    contents = file.write("new text using file.write")
    print(contents)
